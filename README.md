# workflows

## What is in workflows?

This repo contains a [collection of reusable workflows](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/workflows/tree/main/.github/workflows) found helpful for the SS3 project. See [details on what these workflows do](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hniPVEobdzEQqdIsAiHavZgze70TgGQzYiwP7T4SUWw/edit?usp=sharing).

Looking for reusable workflows for R projects? These are now in [nmfs-fish-tools/ghactions4r](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/ghactions4r).

## The Github action I added to my repository failed. What should I do?

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/workflows/issues) or email nmfs.stock.synthesis@noaa.gov. Bugs are always possible, as this repository is still new and experimental.
